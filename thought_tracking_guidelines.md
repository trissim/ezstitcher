# Thought Completion Tracking Guidelines

## Using the `_complete` Suffix

When working with thought files to track progress on complex tasks, use the following conventions:

### Marking Thoughts as Complete

- Add the suffix `_complete` to a thought file's name when you have thoroughly addressed all points covered in that thought.
- Example: Renaming `refactoring_plan.md` to `refactoring_plan_complete.md` indicates that all refactoring tasks outlined in the file have been completed.

### Revisiting Complete Thoughts

- You can add more information to a thought file even after marking it as complete.
- When adding to a complete thought:
  - If the additions are minor clarifications or enhancements that don't require new actions, the file can remain marked as complete.
  - If the additions introduce new tasks or significantly change the scope, remove the `_complete` suffix until these new elements are addressed.

### Tracking Progress

- Use this system to maintain a clear visual indicator of which thought processes are finished and which still require attention.
- When reviewing your work, focus first on thought files that don't have the `_complete` suffix.
- Periodically review complete thoughts to ensure nothing was overlooked.

### Example Workflow

1. Create `architecture_design.md` with initial thoughts
2. Implement the design
3. Rename to `architecture_design_complete.md` when finished
4. Later, if you need to add more considerations:
   - Add them to the file
   - Decide whether these new items require action
   - Remove the `_complete` suffix if necessary until the new items are addressed

This system helps maintain clarity about the status of different thought processes and ensures that all aspects of complex problems are thoroughly addressed before being considered complete.
