# Test Cleanup Summary

## Overview

We've successfully removed all tests except the synthetic tests for both microscopes (ImageXpress and Opera Phenix) using the refactored code. This simplifies the test suite and focuses on the most important tests that validate the core functionality of the library.

## Removed Test Files

The following test files were removed:

1. `test_config.py`
2. `test_config_integration.py`
3. `test_directory_structure_integration.py`
4. `test_directory_structure_manager.py`
5. `test_documentation_examples.py`
6. `test_file_system_manager.py`
7. `test_opera_phenix_support.py`
8. `test_pydantic_config.py`
9. `test_stitcher.py`
10. `test_synthetic_imagexpress.py`
11. `test_synthetic_opera_phenix.py`
12. `test_synthetic_workflow_class_based.py`
13. `test_zstack_processor.py`
14. `test_zstack_processor_refactored.py`

## Kept Test Files

The following test files were kept:

1. `test_synthetic_imagexpress_refactored.py`
2. `test_synthetic_opera_phenix_refactored.py`

These files contain tests that validate the core functionality of the library using synthetic data for both microscope types (ImageXpress and Opera Phenix) with the refactored code.

## Test Coverage

The kept tests cover the following functionality:

1. Directory structure detection
2. Non-Z-stack workflow
3. Multi-channel reference
4. Z-stack projection stitching
5. Z-stack per-plane stitching

All tests are passing, which confirms that the core functionality of the library is working correctly.

## Next Steps

1. Update the documentation to reflect the simplified test suite
2. Consider adding more tests for edge cases and error handling
3. Address the Pydantic deprecation warnings
