# EZStitcher Code Coverage Reports

This site contains the code coverage reports for the [EZStitcher](https://github.com/trissim/ezstitcher) project.

## About

These reports are automatically generated by GitHub Actions whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.
They show the percentage of code that is covered by automated tests.

## Troubleshooting

If you're seeing this README but not the coverage reports, it means the GitHub Pages deployment was successful, but the coverage reports weren't generated correctly. Check the GitHub Actions workflow logs for more information.

## How to Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to the repository settings: https://github.com/trissim/ezstitcher/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
3. Save the settings

This will allow the GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the coverage reports to GitHub Pages.
