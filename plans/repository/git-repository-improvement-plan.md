# Git Repository Improvement Plan

Status: In Progress
Progress: 70%
Last Updated: 2023-07-12
Dependencies: None

## 1. Problem Analysis

The current state of the git repository may have several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Untracked files**: There may be files that should be ignored but are not in `.gitignore`
2. **Large files**: There may be large files that should not be in version control
3. **Temporary files**: There may be temporary files that should be cleaned up
4. **Inconsistent line endings**: There may be inconsistent line endings across files
5. **Commit history**: The commit history may be cluttered or have large commits
6. **Branch structure**: The branch structure may be confusing or outdated

## 2. High-Level Solution

1. **Improve `.gitignore`**: Update the `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files
2. **Clean up large files**: Identify and remove large files from version control
3. **Standardize line endings**: Ensure consistent line endings across files
4. **Organize branches**: Clean up and organize branches
5. **Improve commit practices**: Establish better commit practices

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Improve `.gitignore`

Review and update the `.gitignore` file to exclude:

- Python virtual environments (`.venv`, `venv`, etc.)
- IDE files (`.idea`, `.vscode`, etc.)
- Compiled Python files (`__pycache__`, `*.pyc`, etc.)
- Test data directories (`tests/tests_data/`, etc.)
- Temporary files (`*.tmp`, `*.bak`, etc.)
- Log files (`*.log`, etc.)
- Build artifacts (`dist/`, `build/`, etc.)

```
# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# Logs

# Temporary files

```

### 3.2 Clean up Large Files

1. Identify large files in the repository:
   ```bash
   git rev-list --objects --all | grep -f <(git verify-pack -v .git/objects/pack/*.idx | sort -k 3 -n | tail -10 | awk '{print $1}')
   ```

2. Remove large files from history if necessary:
   ```bash
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch PATH_TO_LARGE_FILE' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```

3. Add large files to `.gitignore` to prevent them from being re-added.

### 3.3 Standardize Line Endings

1. Add a `.gitattributes` file to ensure consistent line endings:
   ```
   # Set default behavior to automatically normalize line endings
   * text=auto

   # Explicitly declare text files to be normalized
   *.py text
   *.md text
   *.txt text
   *.json text
   *.xml text
   *.yml text
   *.yaml text
   *.ini text
   *.cfg text
   *.sh text eol=lf
   *.bat text eol=crlf

   # Declare binary files to be left alone
   *.png binary
   *.jpg binary
   *.jpeg binary
   *.gif binary
   *.tif binary
   *.tiff binary
   *.ico binary
   *.zip binary
   *.gz binary
   *.tar binary
   *.pdf binary
   ```

2. Normalize line endings in the repository:
   ```bash
   git add --renormalize .
   git commit -m "Normalize line endings"
   ```

### 3.4 Organize Branches

1. List all branches:
   ```bash
   git branch -a
   ```

2. Identify and delete obsolete branches:
   ```bash
   git branch -d BRANCH_NAME  # Local branch
   git push origin --delete BRANCH_NAME  # Remote branch
   ```

3. Establish a clear branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow, GitHub Flow) and document it.

### 3.5 Improve Commit Practices

1. Use meaningful commit messages:
   ```
   feat: Add new feature X
   fix: Fix bug in Y
   docs: Update documentation for Z
   refactor: Refactor code in module W
   test: Add tests for feature V
   chore: Update dependencies
   ```

2. Keep commits focused on a single change.

3. Use pull requests for significant changes.

4. Consider using pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality.

## 4. Validation

### 4.1 Repository Size

1. Check repository size before and after cleanup:
   ```bash
   git count-objects -v
   ```

2. Verify that large files have been removed.

### 4.2 File Consistency

1. Check for inconsistent line endings:
   ```bash
   git grep -l $'\r' -- "*.py"
   ```

2. Verify that `.gitignore` is working correctly:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

### 4.3 Branch Structure

1. Verify that obsolete branches have been removed:
   ```bash
   git branch -a
   ```

2. Verify that the branching strategy is being followed.

## 5. Implementation Order

1. ✅ Update `.gitignore`
2. ✅ Add `.gitattributes`
3. ✅ Normalize line endings
4. ⚠️ Clean up large files (partially completed)
5. ✅ Organize branches
6. ✅ Document commit practices

## 6. Benefits

1. **Reduced repository size**: Removing large files reduces clone and fetch times
2. **Cleaner working directory**: Ignoring unnecessary files reduces clutter
3. **Consistent line endings**: Prevents issues with different operating systems
4. **Clearer branch structure**: Makes it easier to understand the project's development
5. **Better commit history**: Makes it easier to understand changes and revert if necessary

## 7. Risks and Mitigations

1. **Risk**: Removing files from history might break references
   **Mitigation**: Communicate changes to all developers and have them re-clone the repository

2. **Risk**: Changing line endings might cause merge conflicts
   **Mitigation**: Normalize line endings in a separate commit and have all developers pull changes

3. **Risk**: Deleting branches might remove important work
   **Mitigation**: Only delete branches that have been merged or are confirmed to be obsolete

## 9. Completion Summary

We have successfully implemented most of the Git repository improvements:

1. ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files:
   - Added `tests/tests_data/` directory
   - Added `node_modules/` directory
   - Added `.coverage` file
   - Added `*_test_output.txt` files

2. ✅ Added `.gitattributes` to ensure consistent line endings

3. ✅ Normalized line endings in the repository

4. ✅ Documented commit practices in `CONTRIBUTING.md`:
   - Added branching strategy
   - Added commit message guidelines
   - Added pull request guidelines
   - Added code style guidelines

5. ⚠️ Partially completed cleaning up large files:
   - Identified large files in the repository
   - Removed deleted files from the repository
   - Need to remove large files from history

The remaining task is to remove large files from the repository history, which requires more careful consideration and coordination with the team.
