## Overview

This document provides a summary of the refactoring plan for the processing pipeline in the ezstitcher project. The refactoring aims to address several code smells identified in the `PipelineOrchestrator` class, particularly in the `process_reference_images` and `process_final_images` methods.

## Identified Code Smells

1. **Duplicate Code Structure**: Both methods follow a very similar pattern.
2. **Temporal Coupling**: The methods must be called in a specific order.
3. **Excessive Method Calls**: Multiple calls to the same method with similar parameters.
4. **Implicit Knowledge**: Reliance on implicit knowledge about directory structure.
5. **Lack of Return Values**: Methods rely on side effects rather than returning values.
6. **Hardcoded Processing Steps**: Processing steps are fixed and difficult to customize.
7. **Complex Parameter Handling**: Complex logic for handling different types of parameters.
8. **Unclear Responsibility Boundaries**: The class has too many responsibilities.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution applies a combination of the Pipeline and Strategy patterns to refactor the processing methods:

1. **Pipeline Pattern**: Create a pipeline of processing steps that can be customized and reordered.
2. **Strategy Pattern**: Encapsulate different processing strategies in separate classes.

## Implementation Plan

The implementation is broken down into six diffs:

1. **Diff 1: Create Core Interfaces and Abstract Classes**
   - Create `ProcessingContext`, `ProcessingStep`, `ProcessingStrategy`, and `ProcessingPipeline` classes

2. **Diff 2: Implement Concrete Processing Steps**
   - Implement `ZStackFlatteningStep`, `ChannelProcessingStep`, and `CompositeCreationStep` classes

3. **Diff 3: Implement Processing Strategies**
   - Implement `ReferenceProcessingStrategy` and `FinalProcessingStrategy` classes

4. **Diff 4: Refactor PipelineOrchestrator**
   - Update `process_reference_images`, `process_final_images`, and `process_well` methods

5. **Diff 5: Update Tests**
   - Add tests for new classes and update existing tests

6. **Diff 6: Update Documentation**
   - Update API documentation, examples, and user guide

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Improved Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility.
2. **Flexibility**: The pipeline can be customized and different strategies can be used.
3. **Testability**: Components can be tested independently.
4. **Reduced Duplication**: Common code is extracted into reusable components.
5. **Explicit Dependencies**: Dependencies are made explicit through the context object.
6. **Better Error Handling**: Errors can be handled at each step or at the pipeline level.
7. **Extensibility**: New steps and strategies can be added without modifying existing code.
8. **Configurability**: The pipeline can be configured at runtime.

## Implementation Status

| Diff | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Create Core Interfaces and Abstract Classes | Not Started |
| 2 | Implement Concrete Processing Steps | Not Started |
| 3 | Implement Processing Strategies | Not Started |
| 4 | Refactor PipelineOrchestrator | Not Started |
| 5 | Update Tests | Not Started |
| 6 | Update Documentation | Not Started |

## Next Steps

1. Implement Diff 1: Create Core Interfaces and Abstract Classes
2. Run tests to ensure that the core interfaces and abstract classes work correctly
3. Proceed with the remaining diffs in order
4. Validate each diff before proceeding to the next

## Conclusion

The proposed refactoring will significantly improve the maintainability, flexibility, and testability of the processing pipeline. By applying the Pipeline and Strategy patterns, we can address the identified code smells and create a more modular and extensible system.
