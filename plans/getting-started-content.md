## 1.2 Quick Start Guide

### Basic Usage with Function-Based API
```python
from ezstitcher.core.main import process_plate_folder

# Process a plate folder with automatic microscope detection
process_plate_folder(
    'path/to/plate_folder',
    reference_channels=["1"],
    tile_overlap=10.0
)
```

### Basic Usage with Object-Oriented API
```python
from ezstitcher.core.config import PipelineConfig, StitcherConfig
from ezstitcher.core.processing_pipeline import PipelineOrchestrator

# Create configuration
config = PipelineConfig(
    reference_channels=["1"],
    stitcher=StitcherConfig(
        tile_overlap=10.0,
        max_shift=50
    )
)

# Create and run pipeline
pipeline = PipelineOrchestrator(config)
pipeline.run("path/to/plate_folder")
```

### Command-Line Interface
```bash
# Basic usage
ezstitcher /path/to/plate_folder --reference-channels 1 --tile-overlap 10

# Z-stack processing
ezstitcher /path/to/plate_folder --reference-channels 1 --focus-detect --focus-method combined

# Help
ezstitcher --help
```
