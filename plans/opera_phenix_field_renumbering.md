# Opera Phenix Field Renumbering Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding field renumbering functionality to the OperaPhenixXmlParser class.

## Overview
The goal is to implement functionality that will remap Opera Phenix field IDs to follow a logical top-left to bottom-right raster pattern based on the position data in the Index.xml file.

## Implementation Steps
1. Create a standalone implementation for testing
2. Test with sample Index.xml files
3. Adapt the implementation for integration with OperaPhenixXmlParser
4. Document the changes
