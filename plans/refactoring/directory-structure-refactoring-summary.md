# Directory Structure Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Classes

#### `ImageLocator` Class
- Centralizes image finding logic
- Provides methods to find images in various directory structures
- Handles different file extensions consistently
- Detects directory structure types

#### `DirectoryStructureManager` Class
- Manages different directory structures
- Provides a consistent interface for accessing images
- Handles Z-stack directories
- Uses FilenameParser for consistent filename parsing

### 2. Updated Existing Classes

#### `FileSystemManager` Class
- Added methods to use `DirectoryStructureManager`
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Provides a cleaner interface for finding images

#### `PlateProcessor` Class
- Updated to use `DirectoryStructureManager`
- Removed hard-coded "TimePoint_1" references
- Handles different directory structures more elegantly

### 3. Created Tests

#### `test_directory_structure_manager.py`
- Tests for the new `DirectoryStructureManager` and `ImageLocator` classes
- Tests different directory structures
- Tests finding images by metadata

#### `test_directory_structure_integration.py`
- Tests integration with `FileSystemManager`
- Tests integration with `PlateProcessor`

## Benefits

1. **Eliminated Hard-Coded Paths**: Removed all hard-coded "TimePoint_1" references
2. **Support for Flexible Directory Structures**: Now handles various directory structures without code duplication
3. **Centralized Directory Structure Logic**: Moved all directory structure handling to a single class
4. **Improved Code Maintainability**: Made the code more maintainable by reducing duplication
5. **Enhanced Extensibility**: Made it easier to add support for new directory structures

## Future Improvements

1. **Update ZStackProcessor**: Update the `ZStackProcessor` class to use `DirectoryStructureManager`
2. **Update PatternMatcher**: Update the `PatternMatcher` class to use `DirectoryStructureManager`
3. **Update Documentation**: Update the documentation to reflect the new architecture
4. **Add Support for More Directory Structures**: Add support for more directory structures as needed
5. **Improve Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling in the new classes
