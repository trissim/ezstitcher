What is EZStitcher?
------------------

EZStitcher is a Python library designed to simplify the processing and stitching of microscopy images. It provides a flexible pipeline architecture that allows researchers to easily process large microscopy datasets, create composite images, flatten Z-stacks, and stitch tiled images together.

**Key Features:**

* **Pipeline Architecture**: Organize processing steps in a logical sequence
* **Automatic Directory Management**: Protect original data while maintaining organized outputs
* **Flexible Function Handling**: Apply various processing functions in different patterns
* **Support for Various Microscope Formats**: Work with data from different microscope types
* **Multithreaded Processing**: Process multiple wells in parallel for faster results

**Use Cases:**

* Processing large microscopy datasets with consistent operations
* Stitching tiled microscopy images into complete well or plate views
* Creating composite images from multiple fluorescence channels
* Flattening Z-stacks into 2D projections
* Applying custom image processing algorithms to microscopy data

EZStitcher is designed for researchers working with microscopy data who need a flexible, code-based approach to image processing and stitching.

Supported Microscope Types
------------------------

EZStitcher currently supports multiple microscope types, including ImageXpress and Opera Phenix.

For detailed information about supported microscope types, including file formats, naming conventions, and directory structures, see :ref:`microscope-formats` and :ref:`microscope-comparison`.

Support for additional microscope types can be added by implementing the appropriate interfaces. See the :doc:`../development/extending` guide for details.

Core Architecture Overview
------------------------

EZStitcher uses a pipeline architecture that organizes processing into a logical sequence of steps. The architecture consists of three main components:

* **PipelineOrchestrator**: Coordinates the execution of pipelines across wells
* **Pipeline**: A sequence of processing steps that are executed in order
* **Step**: A single processing operation that can be applied to images

See the comprehensive :doc:`../getting_started/installation` guide.

Quick Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a quick installation using pip with a virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Create a virtual environment with pyenv
    pyenv install 3.11.0
    pyenv virtualenv 3.11.0 ezstitcher-env
    pyenv activate ezstitcher-env

    # Install EZStitcher
    pip install ezstitcher

Quick Start Example
-----------------

Here's a simple example that demonstrates how to create and run a pipeline for processing and stitching microscopy images:

.. code-block:: python

    from ezstitcher.core.config import PipelineConfig
    from ezstitcher.core.processing_pipeline import PipelineOrchestrator
    from ezstitcher.core.pipeline import Pipeline
    from ezstitcher.core.steps import Step, PositionGenerationStep, ImageStitchingStep
    from ezstitcher.core.image_processor import ImageProcessor as IP

    # Create configuration with 2 worker threads
    config = PipelineConfig(num_workers=2)

    # Create orchestrator with path to microscopy data
    orchestrator = PipelineOrchestrator(config=config, plate_path="path/to/plate")

    # Create pipeline with processing, position generation, and stitching steps
    pipeline = Pipeline(
        steps=[
            # Step 1: Basic processing - normalize image intensities
            Step(
                name="Basic Processing",
                func=IP.stack_percentile_normalize,
                input_dir=orchestrator.workspace_path
            ),
            PositionGenerationStep(),

            # By default, uses previous step's output directory (position files)
            ImageStitchingStep(
                # input_dir=orchestrator.workspace_path  # Uncomment to use original images for stitching
            )
        ],
        name="Simple Pipeline"
    )

    # Run the pipeline
    orchestrator.run(pipelines=[pipeline])

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. We create a configuration with 2 worker threads for parallel processing
2. We create an orchestrator that points to our microscopy data
3. We define a pipeline with three steps:
   - A basic processing step that normalizes image intensities
   - A position generation step that calculates tile positions
   - An image stitching step that combines the processed tiles
4. We run the pipeline using the orchestrator

**Expected Output:**

* Processed images will be saved in the workspace directory with the suffix `_out` (e.g., `plate_workspace_out`)
* Position files will be saved in the workspace directory with the suffix `_positions` (e.g., `plate_workspace_positions`)
* Stitched images will be saved in the workspace directory with the suffix `_stitched` (e.g., `plate_workspace_stitched`)

**Common Issues:**

* **Directory Permissions**: Ensure you have write permissions for the output directories
* **Missing Dependencies**: Make sure all required dependencies are installed
* **Image Format Issues**: Verify that your images are in a supported format
