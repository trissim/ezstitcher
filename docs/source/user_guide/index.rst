This user guide provides a comprehensive overview of EZStitcher, from basic concepts to advanced usage.

The guide is organized by complexity level to provide a clear learning path:

1. **Introduction**: Learn about ezstitcher's architecture and key concepts
2. **Basic Usage (Beginner Level)**: Get started quickly with the EZ module
3. **Transitioning from Basic Usage**: Bridge the gap between the EZ module and custom pipelines
4. **Intermediate Usage**: Create custom pipelines with wrapped steps (NormStep, ZFlatStep, etc.)
5. **Advanced Usage**: Master advanced features and understand how wrapped steps are implemented
6. **Best Practices**: Learn recommended practices for effective use
7. **Integration**: Integrate ezstitcher with other tools and workflows

If you're new to ezstitcher, we recommend starting with the :doc:`../getting_started/quick_start` guide before diving into the User Guide.

.. important::
   The user guide follows a three-tier approach to accommodate different user needs:

   * **Beginner Level (Basic Usage)**: For non-coders and beginners who want minimal code
   * **Intermediate Level (Wrapped Steps)**: For users who need more control with wrapped steps (NormStep, ZFlatStep, etc.)
   * **Advanced Level (Base Step Implementation)**: For users who need to understand implementation details

   Each section is clearly marked with its complexity level to help you navigate the documentation based on your experience.
