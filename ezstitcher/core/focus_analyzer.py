class FocusAnalyzer:
    """
    Provides focus metrics and best focus selection.

    This class implements various focus measure algorithms and methods to find
    the best focused image in a Z-stack. All methods are static and do not require
    an instance.

    Usage:
        The class provides several focus metrics and methods to select the best focused
        image from a Z-stack. The main methods are:

        - find_best_focus: Returns the index of the best focused image in a stack
        - select_best_focus: Returns the best focused image from a stack
        - compute_focus_metrics: Computes focus metrics for all images in a stack

        For most use cases, it's recommended to use the select_best_focus method
        with an explicit metric parameter:

        ```python
        best_image, best_idx, scores = FocusAnalyzer.select_best_focus(
            image_stack,
            metric="laplacian"  # Explicitly specify the metric
        )
        ```

        Available metrics:
        - "combined": Uses a weighted combination of all metrics (default)
        - "normalized_variance" or "nvar": Uses normalized variance
        - "laplacian" or "lap": Uses Laplacian energy
        - "tenengrad" or "ten": Uses Tenengrad variance
        - "fft": Uses adaptive FFT focus measure

        You can also provide a custom weights dictionary for the combined metric:

        ```python
        custom_weights = {'nvar': 0.4, 'lap': 0.4, 'ten': 0.1, 'fft': 0.1}
        best_image, best_idx, scores = FocusAnalyzer.select_best_focus(
            image_stack,
            metric=custom_weights
        )
        ```
    """

    # Default weights for the combined focus measure.
    # These weights are used when no custom weights are provided to the
    # combined_focus_measure method or when using the "combined" metric
    # with find_best_focus, select_best_focus, or compute_focus_metrics.
    # The weights determine the contribution of each focus metric to the final score:
    DEFAULT_WEIGHTS = {
        'nvar': 0.3,  # Normalized variance (robust to illumination changes)
        'lap': 0.3,   # Laplacian energy (sensitive to edges)
        'ten': 0.2,   # Tenengrad variance (based on gradient magnitude)
        'fft': 0.2    # FFT-based focus (frequency domain analysis)
